# GroupPost
Hello! In order to get this project running you will need 2 things,
1: A mySQL database with a table called post grouppostdb
2: node package manager
After you have those you can open the directory in the terminal then go to both the frontend and backend and run `npm install` for both.
after you have done that you can run `npm run build` and then `npm start` for both at the same time and the project should be good to go!
